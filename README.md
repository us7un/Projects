# Projects
Projects I've done through the courses of Computer Engineering/Economics in Bogazici University.

Each project serves a different purpose in learning different aspects of object oriented programming and data structures/algorithms, along with their more advanced usages in systems programming and logic programming.


The economics projects are literature report papers in PDF format.
